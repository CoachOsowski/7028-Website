## üõ† Editing Themes

* Themes live in the `themes/` folder.

* To **edit styles, layouts, or partials**:

  * Change files inside `themes/<theme-name>/`.
  * Or, copy a file from the theme into your project‚Äôs `layouts/` folder and modify it (this overrides the theme‚Äôs version).

    * Example:
      If the theme has `themes/ananke/layouts/_default/single.html`, copy it to `layouts/_default/single.html` and edit.

* For CSS/JS customizations:

  * Many themes let you add your own files in `/assets/` or override SCSS variables.
  * Check the theme‚Äôs documentation.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

* Pushing to `main` triggers GitHub Actions:

  * Builds the site with Hugo.
  * Deploys the output (`/public`) to Bluehost via FTP/SFTP.

No manual deploy step is needed ‚Äî just `git push`.

---

## üîë Common Commands

* Run local server:

  ```bash
  hugo server -D
  ```
* Build site (production):

  ```bash
  hugo --minify
  ```
* Add new page:

Would you like me to also include **Bluehost-specific deployment instructions** (secrets, GitHub Actions workflow, etc.) in this README, or keep it focused just on editing/content?
